% A (minimal) template for problem sets and solutions using the exam document class

% Organization:
%% Define new commands, macros, etc. in macros.tex
%% Anything that you would put before \begin{document} should go in prelude.tex

%% For multiple psets, each should get its own file to \input into main with a \section{}

\input{prelude}
\begin{document}

\input{macros}

%% Content goes here

\section{Integral with Fermi-sphere constraints}
\input{problem1}

\section{Density of states}
\input{problem2}

\section{Reciprocal lattice}
\input{problem3}

\end{document}
